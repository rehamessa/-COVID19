> Dataset Link:- https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2
 #### Content:-
  >The dataset contains 2 Category(Pneumonia/Normal). with Training and Testing.
#### Implementation
  Building an deep learning model to recognise cell images as Infected/Uninfected, Binary classification task. As a deep learning model I used convolution neural network as they perform great in fetching important information from images.
  * VGG-19  convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep.
#### Inspiration
>Save humans by detecting and deploying chest x-ray images that contain covid19 or not!
